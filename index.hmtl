                <p>
                My name is Jagger Badazz, I'm a very passionate 19 year old creator working towards becoming a Showrunner / Creative Producer. This September, I will be returning to Calarts for my second year studying Character Animation. I am currently interning at Six Point Harness animation studios and was previously working at Home Plate Entertainment under Bill Schultz. From illustrating children's books,  to making iOS apps with my friends, I have a wide array of experience. My favorite traditional and digital mediums are ink and Adobe Photoshop. When i'm not drawing or reading scripts until 4 a.m. I enjoy playing soccer and spending time with my friends.
